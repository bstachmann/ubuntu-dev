# UBUNTU-DEV - Ansible configured environment for writing and programming

This is an ansible playbook to configure my working environment.

## Create a VirtualBox Machine

 * Install *Ubuntu* (e.g. 18.04)
 * Install *VirtualBox Guest Additions*
   * Make sure to read the message and check that the additions have been built.
     You may have to install gcc make and perl first.
 
## Create or mount `work` Folder
 
`ubuntu-dev` expects the projects in`/home/<user>/work`.

## Apply UBUNTU-DEV

On the quest, navigate to the project folder:

    cd work/ubuntu-dev

Just copy the template and adjust it for your environment:

    cp sample-ubuntu-dev-vars.yml ~/.ubuntu-dev-vars.yml

Probably you should replace my SSH public key with yours. Well ... unless you want met to visit your machine.

Then start the script to load the required ansible-roles  into ansibles local repository.

    ./prepare-ansible.sh

And then ... TADAAAA ... you can run the playbook:

    ./run-ansible.sh

WARNING: This may take a while. Actually some hours, because it includes an installation of TexLive. You may want to exlude that when running this for the first time:

    ./run-ansible.sh --skip-tags heavy

You can rerun the playbook any time.

## Using Tags

    ./run-ansible.sh --list-tags --list-tasks

I have assigned some [tags](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_tags.html) to enable selective execution of tasks.

* `install` - everything
* `heavy` - things that may take long, e.g. installing TexLive.
* `configure` - configuring the environment

If everything is installed and you want to try some configuration changes, just run:

    ./run-ansible.sh --tags configure
